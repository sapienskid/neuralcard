<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: basic -->
<!-- front -->
What are the three domains of life?

<!-- back -->
The three domains of life are:
1. **Bacteria** - Prokaryotic organisms
2. **Archaea** - Prokaryotic organisms adapted to extreme environments
3. **Eukaryota** - Organisms with membrane-bound organelles

This classification system was proposed by Carl Woese in 1990.
<!-- tags: biology, classification, domains, taxonomy -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: cloze -->
<!-- front -->
{{Prokaryotic}} cells lack a {{nucleus}} and membrane-bound organelles, while {{eukaryotic}} cells contain these structures.
<!-- tags: biology, cells, prokaryotes, eukaryotes -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: multiple-choice -->
<!-- front -->
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of living organisms?

<!-- options -->
Growth and development
Reproduction
Response to environment
Crystallization <!-- correct -->

<!-- back -->
Crystallization is a physical process, not a characteristic of living organisms. The other options (growth, reproduction, and response to environment) are all fundamental characteristics of life.

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: true-false -->
<!-- front -->
All bacteria are harmful to humans.

<!-- back -->
False. While some bacteria can cause diseases, most bacteria are beneficial or harmless. They play crucial roles in ecosystems, digestion, and even antibiotic production.
<!-- correct_answer: False -->
<!-- tags: biology, bacteria, microbiology, misconceptions -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: basic -->
<!-- front -->
What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?

<!-- back -->
**Mitosis:**
- Produces 2 identical daughter cells
- Used for growth and repair
- Maintains chromosome number (diploid)

**Meiosis:**
- Produces 4 genetically different gametes
- Used for sexual reproduction
- Reduces chromosome number by half (haploid)
<!-- tags: biology, cell-division, mitosis, meiosis -->

<!-- type: cloze -->
<!-- front -->
The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy is called {{photosynthesis}}, which occurs in the {{chloroplasts}}.
<!-- tags: biology, plants, photosynthesis, organelles -->

---

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: multiple-choice -->
<!-- front -->
Which molecule carries genetic information in cells?

<!-- options -->
Proteins
Carbohydrates
Lipids
DNA <!-- correct -->

<!-- back -->
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) carries the genetic information in all living organisms. It contains the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.
<!-- tags: biology, genetics, dna, molecules -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: fill-in-the-blank -->
<!-- front -->
The basic unit of life is the __________.

<!-- back -->
cell
<!-- tags: biology, cells, basic-concepts -->

---

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: reversed -->
<!-- front -->
Homeostasis

<!-- back -->
The maintenance of a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions. This is crucial for the survival of organisms.
<!-- tags: biology, physiology, homeostasis, regulation -->

<!-- type: basic -->
<!-- front -->
Solve this genetics problem: In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over short (t). If a heterozygous tall plant is crossed with a short plant, what is the phenotypic ratio of the offspring?

<!-- back -->
**Punnett Square:**
```
  T  t
t Tt tt
t Tt tt
```

**Phenotypic ratio:** 2 tall : 2 short (1:1)

The heterozygous tall plant (Tt) crossed with short (tt) produces 50% tall and 50% short offspring.

<!-- type: cloze -->
<!-- front -->
The {{Krebs cycle}} (also known as the {{citric acid cycle}}) is a series of chemical reactions that occurs in the {{mitochondria}} to generate energy.
<!-- tags: biology, cellular-respiration, krebs-cycle, mitochondria -->

---

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: true-false -->
<!-- front -->
Viruses are considered living organisms.

<!-- back -->
False. Viruses are not considered living organisms because they cannot carry out metabolic processes or reproduce independently. They require a host cell to replicate.
<!-- correct_answer: False -->
<!-- tags: biology, viruses, microbiology, definitions -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: multiple-choice -->
<!-- front -->
Which organelle is responsible for protein synthesis?

<!-- options -->
Mitochondria
Ribosomes <!-- correct -->
Lysosomes
Golgi apparatus

<!-- back -->
Ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis. They can be found free in the cytoplasm or bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
<!-- tags: biology, organelles, protein-synthesis, ribosomes -->

<!-- Anki Card -->
<!-- type: basic -->
<!-- front -->
Explain the structure of DNA.

<!-- back -->
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) has a **double helix structure** composed of:
- **Sugar-phosphate backbone**: Alternating deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups
- **Nitrogenous bases**: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C)
- **Base pairing**: A pairs with T, G pairs with C
- **Antiparallel strands**: Run in opposite directions

This structure was discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953.
